Search RNA Editing sites in REDIportal

<p align="justify"> Searching into REDIportal is quite straightforward and also users with no bioinformatics skills can perform accurate searches across the database. 
RNA editing sites are stored according to their genomic positions and can be retrieved providing a genomic locus (“Genomic Region” field) or 
a known gene symbol (“Gene Name” field). Both fields are mutually exclusive. 
Genomic loci can be interrogated entering chromosome coordinates in the format Chr:start-end (for example chr4:158101247-158308846).</p>
